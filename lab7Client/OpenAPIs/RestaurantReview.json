A good variety of dim sum, sushi, Chinese and even Vietnamese dishes. The service is quick and the food is plentiful. We sat \t\tdown last night and within seconds of turning in our first order, the plates were on\t\tthe table! The teriyaki dishes had the right amount of sauce and weren't\t\tsickeningly sweet. The chicken, fish, and beef were perfectly cooked. The makirolls were neatly rolled, cut properly and seasoned well. Loved the General Tao\t\tchicken, the steamed BBQ pork buns, the eel sushi and the lovely eggplant. We\t\twill be going back again! I would highly recommend it.\t\t","address":{"street":"1000 Woodroffe Avenue","city":"Montrial","provinceState":8,"postalCode":"A1A 1A1"}},{"id":3,"name":"Baker Street TexMex Grill","foodType":"Mexican","rating":2,"cost":3,"summary":"\n\t\t  My favorite restaurant in Ottawa. The family who owns it are very warm and \n\t\t  lovely people. They are incredible at recognizing you when you come back. The\n\t\t  burritos are super good. You can customize however you want (guac is included!).\n\t\t  I especially love that there is cactus in the veggie mix; it is a small, special thing\n\t\t  that sets this place apart from other Mexican spots downtown.\n\t\t","address":{"street":"200 Baker Street","city":"Ottawa","provinceState":6,"postalCode":"K1K 1K1"}}]
